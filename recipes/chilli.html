            <li>1 Tsp Ground Cumin</li>
            <li>1 500g Lean Minced Beef</li>
            <li>1 Beef Stock Cube</li>
            <li>400g Can Chopped Tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 Tsp Sugar</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Tomato Purée</li>
            <li>410g Can Red Kidney Beans</li>
            <li>Plain Boiled Long Grain Rice<br>to serve</li>
            <li>Sour Cream<br>to serve</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare your vegetables. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. </li>
            <li>Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.</li>
            <li>Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot.</li>
            <li>Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft and slightly translucent.</li>
            <li>Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tbsp hot chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.<br>Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula.<br>Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.</li>
            <li>Add a 400g can of chopped tomatoes, 1 tsp sugar and add a good shake of salt and pepper. Squirt in about 2 tbsp tomato purée and stir the sauce well.</li>
            <li>Simmer it gently. Bring the whole thing to the boil, give it a good stir and put a lid on the pan. Turn down the heat until it is gently bubbling and leave it for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Check on the pan occasionally to stir it and make sure the sauce doesn’t catch on the bottom of the pan or isn’t drying out. If it is, add a couple of tablespoons of water and make sure that the heat really is low enough. After simmering gently, the saucy mince mixture should look thick, moist and juicy.</li>
            <li>Drain and rinse a 410g can of red kidney beans in a sieve and stir them into the chilli pot. Bring to the boil again, and gently bubble without the lid for another 10 minutes, adding a little more water if it looks too dry.<br>Taste a bit of the chilli and season to taste.</li>
            <li>Now replace the lid, turn off the heat and leave your chilli to stand for 10 minutes before serving. This is really important as it allows the flavours to mingle.</li>
            <li>Serve with sour cream and plain boiled long grain rice.</li>
